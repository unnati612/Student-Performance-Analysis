# Student Performance Analysis using NumPy & Statistics

This project analyzes student academic performance using Python’s NumPy library and basic statistical techniques. 
The dataset is simulated to represent marks of 100 students across three subjects: Maths, Science, and English.

## Objectives
- Analyze subject-wise performance using descriptive statistics
- Identify top and bottom performers using percentile analysis
- Determine pass/fail status based on minimum score criteria
- Study relationships between subjects using correlation

## Analysis Performed
- Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation calculation
- Total score computation for each student
- Top 10% and Bottom 10% student identification
- Pass and fail classification based on subject thresholds
- Correlation analysis between subjects
- Visualization of total scores using histograms with mean and percentile lines

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Basic Statistics

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with NumPy arrays and vectorized operations
- Practical application of descriptive statistics and percentiles
- Data interpretation using visualizations
- Understanding of correlation and performance trends

## Output
The project includes graphical visualization to clearly represent the distribution of student scores and performance trends.
